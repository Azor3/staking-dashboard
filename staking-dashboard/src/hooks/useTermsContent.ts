      title: "1. General Provisions",
      content: `Welcome to stake.aztec.network, a web-hosted user interface (the “<b>Staking Services</b>”) made available by Aztec Foundation (“<b>Foundation</b>”, “<b>Company</b>”, “<b>We</b>”, “<b>Us</b>”, or “<b>Our</b>”).  The Staking Services allow You to connect Your Digital Wallet (as defined below) to stake Your AZTEC tokens (“<b>AZTEC</b>” or “<b>Tokens</b>”), the native tokens of the Aztec network (“<b>Aztec Network</b>”), in order to participate in the Aztec Network and receive Rewards (as defined below) for Your contributions to it.

These Staking Terms of Use ("<b>Staking Terms</b>") are entered into between Us and any individuals, whether on their own behalf or on behalf of entities (including DAOs) (“<b>You</b>”, or “<b>User</b>”), who access or use the Staking Services. These Staking Terms will remain in full force and effect for the period where you access or use the Staking Services. By using the Staking Services, You agree to be bound by these Staking Terms.  If You do not agree to these Staking Terms, or if You cannot legally bind any company, organization or other entity You represent, You must not access or use the Staking Services.

The Staking Services display data and provide certain tools and functionality to facilitate a user’s access to the staking functionality of the Aztec Network. However, Aztec Network itself and the associated software are not part of the Staking Services. There may be other ways to engage with the staking functionality of the Aztec Network other than by using the Staking Services.  Other developers are free to create their own staking interfaces, and you may also interact with the network protocol directly. You acknowledge and agree that we make no representations and warranties with respect to the Aztec Network. Your use of the Aztec Network, including its staking functionality, is entirely at your own risk.  You can find more information about the operation of the Aztec Network, including the staking functionality and the requirements for operating a sequencer, at <a href="http://aztec.network/economic-whitepaper" target="_blank">http://aztec.network/economic-whitepaper</a> (the “<b>White Paper</b>”).

You also agree that these Staking Terms shall be read together with Our Privacy Policy and Our Terms of Service  (together, the “<b>General Terms</b>”), which are incorporated herein by reference. These Staking Terms shall be read to be consistent with the General Terms to the greatest extent possible. In the event of a direct conflict between these Staking Terms and the General Terms, these Staking Terms shall control but only with respect to Your use of the Staking Services.`

      title: "2. Staking Dashboard",
      content: `The Staking Services allow you to register a sequencer on the Aztec Network and to make information about that sequencer available to third party stakers who may wish to delegate to your sequencer.  The Staking Services also allow you to stake your Aztec Tokens to a sequencer you operate, or to a sequencer operated by a third party that you select.  

The Staking Services do not include the operation of any sequencers.  The Staking Services make information about third-party sequencers available to you, but this information is drawn from the Aztec Network and the third-party sequencers themselves.  We do not endorse any particular sequencer, and we are not responsible or liable for, and make no representations as to, any third-party sequencer.  We are not responsible for examining or evaluating any information provided by third-party sequencers, and You irrevocably waive any claim against Us with respect to the operation of any third-party sequencer.  We are not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your staking of Aztec Tokens to any third-party sequencer.  

The Staking Services also allow you to “unstake” or withdraw your Aztec Tokens so that you can use them for other purposes.  Unstaking is subject to an unbonding period as described in the White Paper.

To use the Staking Services, you will need to connect a compatible third-party digital wallet (“<b>Wallet</b>”). By using a Wallet in connection with the Staking Services, you agree that you are using the Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable third-party provider of such Wallet. The Staking Services do not effectuate any transfers of your Aztec Tokens, and we do not have possession, custody or control over your Aztec Tokens when you use the Staking Services. When you interact with the Staking Services, you retain control over your Aztec Tokens at all times. We accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a Wallet, and we make no representations or warranties regarding how the Staking Services will operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet.`

      title: "3. Rewards and Fees",
      content: `The Aztec Network may distribute rewards to operators of sequencers and delegators of Aztec Tokens.  These rewards are distributed automatically to your connected Wallet through the operation of the Aztec Network, and not through the Staking Services.  The Staking Services may display the rewards allocated to your connected Wallet.`

      title: "4. Disclaimers and Limitation on Liability",
      content: `<b>This section limits the liability that we accept, and the types of damages that you may be able to recover from us. Please read it carefully.</b>

We do not exclude or restrict our liability in any way that would be unlawful (including Our liability for any death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or for any fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by us, our employees or directors). The exclusions and limitations below are all subject to this statement. References to liability in this section include every kind of liability arising under or in connection with these Staking Terms, including liability in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise.

We are not responsible and do not accept liability for loss or damage that is not ‘foreseeable’. Loss or damage is ‘foreseeable’ if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time You agree to these Staking Terms, both You and We are aware that it might occur.

We are not liable to You for any failure to perform our responsibilities: (a) due to any abnormal or unforeseeable event outside Our reasonable control (including but not limited to acts of terrorism, significant weather-related events such as major floods, general strikes, general Internet outages, or epidemics or pandemics) and despite Us having taken reasonable precautions against such events; or (b) where performing Our responsibilities would put Us in breach of applicable law (e.g., where We have reasonable grounds to suspect that the Staking Services are being used for fraud).

We do not accept liability for losses You may suffer as a result of Your failure to provide us with accurate information or to comply with these Staking Terms or the General Terms, or Your inability to pay any network fees to third parties to redeem the rewards.

While we will use reasonable care and skill to keep the Staking Services available, we do not promise or guarantee that they will be uninterrupted or always accessible. We do not accept liability for any losses you may suffer due to such interruptions or inaccessibility.

While we take reasonable steps to protect the security of the Staking Services, we do not promise that they are free from viruses, malware, and other digital security threats. You should take standard precautions to protect yourself, your systems, your equipment, and your Ethereum wallet from such threats.

We are not responsible for any interruption to or inaccessibility of the Staking Services due to network problems or outages or other third party infrastructure that we rely on to provide the services.

Our total liability to you arising from, or in connection with, these Staking Terms shall not exceed the greater of one hundred dollars ($100.00), or the amount You paid Us, if any, in the past six (6) months for the Staking Services giving rise to the claim.`

      title: "5. Acknowledgement; Assumption of Risks",
      content: `You acknowledge that Aztec Foundation makes no commitments, representations or warranties regarding, nor is responsible for, the amount of staking rewards received by You from the Protocol as a result of the use of Staking Services.

You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, the “Taxes”) associated with any staking rewards You may receive. You agree that You will pay or reimburse Us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction.

We reserve the right to disable or modify access to the Staking Services (such as restricting features of the Staking Services) at any time [where reasonably required for reasons related to the security of data, users and the services or compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, where we are making changes to our services generally, or where: (i) you breach these Terms or the General Terms in a serious or repeated manner; (ii) we reasonably believe that you are using the Staking Services (or are allowing someone else to use them) in breach of any applicable laws, rules or regulations, or in furtherance of illegal, fraudulent or prohibited activities; or (iii) we are required to do so by any law, regulation, court order or instruction from an ombudsman, regulator or government body / for any reason, including if We reasonably believe any of Your representations and warranties may be untrue or inaccurate. While we take reasonable steps to ensure the availability of the Staking Services, we cannot guarantee that they will always be available or that they will be available at any particular time. Subject to Section 4, We will not be liable to You for any losses or damages You may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Staking Services being inaccessible to You at any time for any reason.

The Staking Services may evolve, which means We may apply changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Staking Services at any time in Our sole discretion.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE STAKING SERVICES THAT WE CAN LAWFULLY PROVIDE. ACCORDINGLY, STAKING SERVICES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE RESTRICTED IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OR REGIONS OR TO CERTAIN USERS. YOU SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMING YOURSELF ABOUT AND OBSERVING ANY RESTRICTIONS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE STAKING SERVICES IN EACH JURISDICTION FROM WHICH YOU ACCESS THE STAKING SERVICES.

WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE STAKING SERVICES FROM TIME TO TIME WHERE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR REASONS RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF DATA, USERS AND THE SERVICES, WHERE WE ARE MAKING CHANGES TO OUR SERVICES GENERALLY, OR WHERE WE REASONABLY BELIEVE YOU HAVE BREACHED THESE GENERAL TERMS OR AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME.`

      title: "6. Indemnification",
      content: `In addition to Your indemnification obligations under the General Terms, You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Aztec Foundation, its partners, agents, officers, directors, contractors, and employees from and against any losses, costs, expenses, claims, injuries or damages (including, without limitation, judicial, arbitrational, and attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred due to or arising out of Your use of Staking Services and any breach by You of any representation, warranty or provision of these Staking Terms.`

      title: "7. General Provisions",
      content: `We reserve the right to alter, amend or modify these Staking Terms from time to time, including without limitation in connection with technical developments or any change or improvement of the Staking Services or to comply with legal requirements. If we make changes to these Staking Terms, we will use reasonable endeavours to give you reasonable advance notice (except where this is not possible due to the need to implement changes immediately, e.g., for security reasons) and update the ‘Effective Date’ on these Staking Terms. It is Your responsibility to review these Staking Terms from time to time. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using Staking Services. By continuing to use the Staking Services, You automatically agree and accept their provisions and give Your consent to be bound by them.

Should any part or provision of these Staking Terms be held to be invalid by any competent court, governmental or administrative authority having jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Staking Terms shall nonetheless remain valid. The same shall apply if and to the extent that these Staking Terms are found to contain any gaps or omissions.

These Staking Terms and the General Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and Us with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Staking Terms supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of the Staking Terms.`
