## Security Policy

We take the security of the Aztec Staking Dashboard seriously and strongly encourage researchers to report security vulnerabilities privately. Please use the guidelines below when reporting security issues.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

- **Do not** open public GitHub issues or pull requests for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please use the [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/staking-dashboard/security/advisories/new) process on GitHub. 

- Navigate to the "Security" tab of this repository.
- Click "Report a vulnerability" on the left sidebar.
- Fill out the form with the details of your discovery:
    1. Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
    2. Steps to reproduce (including logs, requests, or PoCs as appropriate)
    3. Environment details (browser, OS, network assumptions)

You can also email security@aztec.foundation

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as reasonably possible
- Investigate and validate the issue
- Work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you when appropriate

If you believe a vulnerability is actively being exploited or has severe impact (e.g. loss of funds, key compromise, or broad user impact), please clearly mark the report as **CRITICAL** in the pvr/email subject.

## Reporting Non‑Security Bugs and Feature Requests

For issues that are **not** security-sensitive (UI glitches, performance problems, feature requests, etc.):

- **Use GitHub Issues** to report bugs, following the guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Use GitHub Issues or Discussions** to suggest new features or enhancements

Keeping normal bugs and feature requests public helps the community track progress and collaborate on fixes, while keeping security issues private helps protect users until a fix is available.
